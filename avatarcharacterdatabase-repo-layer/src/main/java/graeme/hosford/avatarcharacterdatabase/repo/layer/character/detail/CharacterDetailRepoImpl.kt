    * The API gives back different responses for characters depending on whether or not a
    * characterId is included in the request. Getting a list of all characters will include less
    * info in the JSON response for each individual character than getting a
    * single character by their Id.
    *
    * This means that despite getting all character info on app startup for the list of characters
    * and storing it in the database, we cannot simply pull from the database here and avoid the
    * network call as some information will be missing in the entity when the detail is looked at
    * for the first time. This means a network call must happen every time and cannot be avoided
    * when the database is already populated like in #getCharacterList.
    *
    * The result of this is that when opening a character detail for the first time the list will
    * briefly contain only partial data until the network response comes through. Each time opening
    * the character detail after that will not have this issue but the network request will
    * still be made regardless.
