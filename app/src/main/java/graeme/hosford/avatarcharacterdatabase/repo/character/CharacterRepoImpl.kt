    * The logic here avoids the network call when the database has values because the data on the

    *
    * This allows us to avoid the network call in some instances once the database is populated.
    * This logic would not work if the server-side data was changing and would need to instead match
    * the Flow logic in #getSingleCharacter below.
    *
    * Despite this the logic here may need to change in future anyway if I implement pagination.
    * Right now the network call pulls the first 100 characters from the server when there are
    * close to 500 there. This is a hardcoded limit right now to save on load times and data usage.

    * The API gives back different responses for characters depending on whether or not a
    * characterId is included in the request. Getting a list of all characters will include less
    * info in the JSON response for each individual character than getting a
    * single character by their Id.
    *
    * This means that despite getting all character info on app startup for the list of characters
    * and storing it in the database, we cannot simply pull from the database here and avoid the
    * network call as some information will be missing in the entity when the detail is looked at
    * for the first time. This means a network call must happen every time and cannot be avoided
    * when the database is already populated like in #getCharacterList.
    *
    * The result of this is that when opening a character detail for the first time the list will
    * briefly contain only partial data until the network response comes through. Each time opening
    * the character detail after that will not have this issue but the network request will
    * still be made regardless.
